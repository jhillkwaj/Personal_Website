    <h2>Mega Star Boss Prime</h2>
    <p>Mega Star Boss Prime is a 1v3 couch game created in 28 hours by Paulo Alves, Ricardo Escobar, Justin Hill, and Matthew Stromberg for the 2015 Jolly Game Jam at The University of Texas at Austin. Three players work together to control a large boss ship while one tries to dodge lasers in a small ship. The large ship must hit the small ship with its mega-laser to destroy it but this requires all three players to work together to charge it. The boss ships movement is also determined cooperatively. This project was done in Unity and I was in charge of programming the game mechanics. The game features support for a variety of different controller inputs.</p>
