    <h2>Mythical Maze</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYcIUfOGaE8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Mythical Maze is a tetris inspired game created in Java by Justin Hill, Richard Dong, Richard Wu, and Abhijeet Venkataraman for the 2014-2015 BPA Software Engineering Team contest. The game placed 4th at Nationals in Anaheim, California in May 2015. In the game players try to make paths between two points on a board by using tetris shaped pieces that containe walls and open sides. Unlike the other two games where I did all the actual programing, during the development of Mythic Maze I split the programing work for this game with Richard Dong so I could work on Comet Reader at the same time. </p>

    <p>Pyramid Plunderer is a platformer that placed 4th at BPA Nationals Software Engineering Team in 2014 in Indianapolis, Indiana. The game was created by  Justin (Team Lead, Code), Amir (Documentation Presenation), Mohit (Documentation), and Jeevan (Art). The game was programed from the ground up in Java over the course of six months. The highlight of this game was its randomization engine that allowed for essentially an infinite number of different weapons and levels to be generated.</p>
