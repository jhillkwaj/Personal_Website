    <h2>HOUalert</h2>
    <p>HOUalert was created at the City of Houston Hackathon 2015. After experiencing a recent storm, and the subsequent pandemonium, we were inspired to create a system that would conglomerate all current emergency, weather, and public works data into a seamless and easy to use interface. Using the revolutionary ESRI mapping system, we were able to layer 311, Police, Fire, Weather, and Hurricane data, resulting in one map that accomplishes what previously took four. We were awarded a prize of the best use of ESRI technology. I was in charge of scraping data from various websites and writing parts of the Android code. </p>
