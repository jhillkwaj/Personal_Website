  <h2>JPMoran Chase Code for Good</h2>
  <p>I Participated in the JPMoran Chase Code for Good event in Columbus, Ohio where I worked with four other college students from across the country and JPMoran Chase employees to develop and build ways for the Lebron James Family Foundation to better motivate and track the progress of high school students in Akron, Ohio. We used the Amazon Echo and AWS to create a system where students could use voice control to record and receive messages regarding their academic and social progress with their teachers and counselors.</p>
